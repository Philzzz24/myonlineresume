  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a self-taught junior web developer with a background in
    teaching and data analytics. After 10 years of helping students
    understand math and science, I discovered a new passion for 
    building things on the web. I’ve since been diving deep into 
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, studying full-time to become a 
    front-end developer. I'm excited to grow in this field
    and contribute to projects that make a real impact.
